    		<h1> Favorites </h1>
        	<p> One of My Favorite things to do is to play Video Games, I usually play most of the genres but
                I am mostly fond of "Sandbox", "Strategy", "Role-Playing", and "First-Person Shooter". One of
                my favorite games is Stardew Valley, Fallout, Battlefield and many more.</p>

            <p> Also, I like writing some stories. The genres that I usually write are "Science-Fiction", "Post
                Apocalyptic", and "Slice-of Life". I do not publish any of my works on the Internet or anything,
                I just want to write some stories that I could think of and let some of my friends read it.</p>

                    <p> Lorenzo "Lopao" Llamanzares is one of my friends that I've met during 2018, We've met in
                        a Local Computer Cafe as one of my colleagues invited him also and we've played a couple 
                        of games,  We really don't know each other at that time but the next thing we realized is
                        that we already became friends. We played at the local computer cafe alongside with our
                        other friends for years until the Pandemic came along.  </p>

                        one of Lopao's friends that I've met during that time. As with lopao, we played at the
